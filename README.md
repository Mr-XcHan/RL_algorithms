# RL_algorithms
Basic reinforcement learning algorithm (in python and tensorflow 2.X)


# Overview

  there are simple tutorial of deep reinforcement learning, which includes simple demos and detailed model implementations to help beginners to understand the reinforcement learning.
  Certainly，these are the basic algorithm ideas and frameworks. But it's enough for you to understand.
  
# Ongoing Work

  Policy-based RL algorithms.
  such as :     
   1、PPO
   
   2、D4PG
   
   3、SAC
   
    ...
